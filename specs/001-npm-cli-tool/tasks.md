# Tasks: Xray 服务管理 CLI 工具

**Feature Branch**: `001-npm-cli-tool`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-npm-cli-tool/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: According to the project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`), **Test-First Development is MANDATORY** for all core features. Tests MUST be:
1. Written BEFORE implementation
2. Approved by user
3. Run and FAIL (Red)
4. Then implement to pass (Green)
5. Refactor as needed

**Test Priority**: Security features > Core features > Auxiliary features

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project structure

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project directory structure (src/, tests/, bin/)
- [x] T002 Initialize Node.js project with package.json (name: xray-manager, version: 1.0.0)
- [x] T003 [P] Install production dependencies (@inquirer/prompts, commander, chalk@4, ora, clipboardy)
- [x] T004 [P] Install development dependencies (typescript, @types/node, vitest, @vitest/ui, c8, eslint, prettier)
- [x] T005 [P] Configure TypeScript (tsconfig.json) with target ES2020, module commonjs, outDir dist, rootDir src
- [x] T006 [P] Configure Vitest (vitest.config.ts) with c8 coverage provider, 80% thresholds
- [x] T007 [P] Configure ESLint and Prettier
- [x] T008 [P] Configure package.json bin field (xray-manager and xm aliases pointing to dist/cli.js)
- [x] T009 [P] Create .gitignore (node_modules, dist, coverage, .env)
- [x] T010 Add npm scripts (build, dev, test, test:watch, test:coverage, lint, format)

**Checkpoint**: ✅ Basic project structure ready

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T012 [P] Create TypeScript types in src/types/service.ts (ServiceStatus, ServiceOperationResult)
- [x] T013 [P] Create TypeScript types in src/types/user.ts (User, CreateUserParams, UserShareInfo)
- [x] T014 [P] Create exit code constants in src/constants/exit-codes.ts (ExitCode enum)
- [x] T015 [P] Create path constants in src/constants/paths.ts (DEFAULT_PATHS)
- [x] T016 [P] Create timeout constants in src/constants/timeouts.ts (TIMEOUTS object)
- [x] T017 [P] Implement validator utils in src/utils/validator.ts (isValidEmail, isValidUuid, isValidPort, etc.)
- [x] T018 [P] Implement format utils in src/utils/format.ts (maskSensitiveValue, formatUptime, formatBytes)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P1 → P2 → P3 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1, but both needed for MVP
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on ConfigManager from US3, but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses ConfigManager (may need to extend it)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from all other stories

### Within Each User Story

- **Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation** (Constitution Principle IV)
- Models/Classes before services
- Services before commands
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models/classes within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 2 together:
# T037, T038, T039, T040 can all be written in parallel

# After tests approved and failing:
# Launch some implementation tasks in parallel:
# T045 (SystemdManager class stub)
# Can be done while others work on T046, T047 (permission checks)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Interactive Menu)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Service Control)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both stories independently
6. Deploy/demo MVP

**Estimated Time**: ~5-7 days (1 developer, TDD approach)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Partial MVP)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Full MVP! ✅)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

**Estimated Time**: ~2-3 weeks (1 developer, TDD approach)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (~1 day)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (or start on User Story 4/5)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

**Estimated Time**: ~1-1.5 weeks (3 developers, TDD approach)

---

## TDD Workflow (Red-Green-Refactor-Commit)

### Mandatory for ALL User Stories

```bash
# Terminal 1: ALWAYS running
npm run test:watch

# Terminal 2: Development
```

### For Each Task:

1. **RED**: Write test, see it fail
   ```bash
   # Write test in tests/unit/services/systemd-manager.test.ts
   # Watch mode shows ❌ FAIL
   ```

2. **GREEN**: Implement minimum code to pass
   ```typescript
   // Implement in src/services/systemd-manager.ts
   // Watch mode shows ✅ PASS
   ```

3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality
   ```typescript
   // Extract functions, improve naming
   // Watch mode confirms ✅ PASS still
   ```

4. **COMMIT**: Save progress
   ```bash
   git add src/ tests/
   git commit -m "feat: implement SystemdManager.getStatus()"
   ```

### Coverage Gates

- Unit tests: 80% lines, 80% functions, 75% branches
- Run before commit: `npm run test:coverage`
- CI/CD will enforce these thresholds

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **Verify tests fail before implementing** (Red phase)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---

## Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 141
- **Setup**: 10 tasks
- **Foundational**: 9 tasks (BLOCKS all stories)
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 17 tasks (MVP - Interactive Menu)
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: 24 tasks (MVP - Service Control)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: 22 tasks (User Management)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: 12 tasks (Config Management)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: 11 tasks (Log Viewing)
- **Polish**: 18 tasks

**MVP Scope** (Minimal Viable Product): User Story 1 + User Story 2 = 41 implementation tasks (+ 19 foundational = 60 total)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Setup: 7 parallel tasks
- Foundational: 9 parallel tasks
- Per story: 3-8 parallel tasks (tests, models, utils)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Run `xray-manager`, verify menu displays
- US2: Select "Service Status", verify display; Select "Restart", verify graceful shutdown
- US3: Select "User Management", verify add/delete/show workflows
- US4: Select "Config Management", verify backup/restore workflows
- US5: Select "Logs", verify real-time and filtered viewing

**Constitution Compliance**: ✅ All 5 Principles enforced through task structure
