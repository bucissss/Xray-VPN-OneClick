# Quickstart: Improved CLI Aesthetics

The interactive CLI has been visually refined for a more modern, cleaner experience.

## What's New?

- **Lighter Dashboard**: The top status dashboard now uses cleaner single-line borders and optimized spacing.
- **Simplified Navigation**: The "sandwich" lines around the breadcrumb navigation are gone, replaced by a clean path indicator.
- **Unified Colors**: The "rainbow" menu is replaced with a professional, consistent color theme (Primary Cyan, Semantic Green/Red).

## How to Verify

1. **Launch Interactive Mode**:
   ```bash
   xray-manager
   ```

2. **Observe Dashboard**:
   - Check that the border is a single line (`│` `─`) instead of heavy/double lines.
   - Status indicators should be simple dots (`●`) rather than fully colored text lines.

3. **Navigate**:
   - Enter "User Management".
   - Notice the breadcrumb `Home > User Management` appears cleanly without heavy divider lines above/below.

4. **Menu Colors**:
   - Menu options should feel cohesive, using primarily neutral tones for labels and accent colors for icons/highlights.
